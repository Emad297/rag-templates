This notebook focuses on the embedding and vector storage aspects of GraphRAG. We'll explore different embedding models, optimization techniques, and vector operations.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Learn

- Different embedding models and their trade-offs
- Vector storage optimization techniques
- Hybrid search strategies (dense + sparse)
- Embedding fine-tuning for domain-specific tasks
- Performance benchmarking and evaluation

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of vector embeddings
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts
- Completed main GraphRAG tutorial

Let's dive into the world of embeddings! ðŸš€
