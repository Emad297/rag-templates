## 🗄️ Sample Data Structure

The tutorial uses a medical symptoms dataset with this structure:

```yaml
- category: General Symptoms
  symptoms:
    - name: Fever
      description: Elevated body temperature above 100.4°F (38°C)
      medical_practice: General Medicine
      possible_treatments:
        - Rest and hydration
        - Acetaminophen or ibuprofen
        - Cool compresses
```

This creates rich relationships between:
- **Symptoms** ↔ **Treatments** (treats relationship)
- **Symptoms** ↔ **Medical Practices** (practiced_by relationship)
- **Treatments** ↔ **Other Symptoms** (shared treatment relationships)

## 🎯 GraphRAG Benefits Demonstrated

### 1. Enhanced Context Discovery
- **Traditional RAG**: "headache" → finds similar symptoms
- **GraphRAG**: "headache" → finds symptoms + related treatments + specialists + connected conditions

### 2. Relationship-Aware Responses
- Discovers hidden connections between medical entities
- Provides comprehensive treatment recommendations
- Identifies relevant medical specialties

### 3. Reduced Hallucination
- Responses grounded in structured knowledge graph
- Verifiable entity relationships
- Confidence scoring based on graph connectivity

### 4. Multi-hop Reasoning
- Traverses graph to find indirect relationships
- Connects symptoms through shared treatments
- Builds comprehensive medical context
